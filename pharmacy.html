                <h3>INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION TO PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE:</h3>

                <p>Pharmacy broadly falls under the category of health science. Without pharmaceuticals, Health science as we know it would have been an impossible dream. Without pharmaceutical sectorsand their students, Hospitals would be extinct and people would have no antibiotics orwould've taken ill treatments and like Mark Twain once famously teased,
                    - "Be careful when you take an antibiotic, you may die of a misprint ".</p>

                <h3>UNDERSTANDING THE DEFINITION AND MEANING OF PHARMACY-EXPLANATION:</h3>
                <p>Pharmacy is the clinical health science that links medical science with chemistry and it is charged with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs. The practice of pharmacy requires excellent knowledge of drugs, their mechanism of action, side effects, interactions, 
                    mobility and toxicity. At the same time, it requires knowledge of treatment and understanding of the pathological process</p>

                <p><u>are our LIFELINE between life and death. Louis XIV once quoted the Bible saying. 
                    Even if you err. Err on the side of living!</u> <br>

            <div class="text-container">
                <h3>++ SCOPE OF PHARMACY AS OF NOW</h3>
                <p><u>The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications, and it also includes more modern services related to health care, including clinical services,
                    reviewing medications for safety and efficacy. and providing drug information.</u>
                    <br>
                    This is why one who is interested in Pharmaceuticals as a subject must follow their passion and indulge in courses offered by our SXB university which has a branch of learning for pharmacy, I. E.,
                         Kerala Academy of Pharmacy learning offers two major courses in pharmacy targeting the streams in pharmacy.

Sometimes we humans take things for granted but we must always remember that without in store pharmacy and pharmaceuticals as a industry, doctors wouldn't suggest any anti-depressants and anti- psychotic drugs or pain killers and antibiotics
            and life support systems would be unknown to humanity<br><br>
            Without anti psychotics, crime and violence would skyrocket and murders per city will reach a number impossible to fathom Without anti depressants, suicides will also go over the roof and such situations will cause mayhem in the country, 
            in the USA, mass shootings in schools and theatres are such fine examples<br><br>


            Some streams in pharmacy are Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy, pharmaceutical chemistry, Pharmacognosy and pharmaceuticals, each specializing in a field of elaborate study dedicated to health science sector and these integrated courses are offered in our Kerala academy of pharmacy which is ably administered by professionals who are easy going talented and friendly

        <h3>FINAL REPORT:</h3>
        <p><b>My favourite choice is Pharmacology (Biology +pharmacy+ natural resources) and it's overlapping on biomedical 
            science that studies the effects of drugs on animals and living organisms. Why this is most necessary? The current
             pandemic SARS Corona has been a threat to our lives and it's a sorry plight and<br><br>

            such analysis and tests of natural pharmaceuticals on living organisms and using pharmaceuticals on us is 
            an necessity to arrive to conclusions that can save mankind from unforeseen hazards. Such is the use of these pharmaceuticals
             direly important to us and all these streams are now gaining massive momentum to reach excellence in the future of biochemistry,
              biomedical and biopharmaceutical sectors which will help us obtain tablets and injections faster than don before. 
              This is why we must encourage our youth to take up a course on pharmacy as they alone have the strength in their
               veins and agility in their bodies to dedicate a life in service to humans.<br><br>
            
            After all, isn't service to mankind service to God ?!?</b>
